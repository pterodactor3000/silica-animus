name: rites-of-cleaning
description: Clean and triage a task backlog via MCP (Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues). Detects duplicate issues, tags missing metadata (assignee, acceptance criteria, milestone/epic), and flags stale work (2+ weeks). Requires explicit user approval before any write. Use when the user asks to clean the backlog, triage issues, close duplicates, tag untriaged work, flag stale tickets, or invokes rites-of-cleaning.

# Backlog Cleaning

Use this skill when the user says "clean backlog", "triage issues", "close duplicates", "tag untriaged", "flag stale", or "rites-of-cleaning".

**Writes are forbidden until Step 5 approval.** Steps 1–4 are read-only.

## Workflow

1. **Discover provider** — scan enabled MCP servers for issue/task tools. If the user names a provider, use it when available. If none qualifies, say so and stop. Read tool schemas before any MCP call.
2. **Resolve scope** — default to the user's team or project active backlog (non-done, non-canceled). Narrow when the user names a team, project, sprint, or cycle.
3. **Fetch & analyze** — pull active issues (paginate at limits). Normalize to the common shape in [provider-adapters.md](references/provider-adapters.md). Apply rules in [cleaning-rules.md](references/cleaning-rules.md). For every issue that may appear in an overview, fetch full description when the list response is truncated — extract a **one-line summary** (prefer `## Outcome`, else first substantive sentence, else roadmap/change ID). Build the cleaning plan; do not mutate anything yet.
4. **Present findings** — post the counts-only findings block as the first part of your reply. **End this section before the overview** — user reads counts first.
5. **Approval gate (mandatory)** — one category per **assistant turn**. Each turn is: findings or overview **in plain chat text only**, then a one-line approval ask. **Do not call `AskQuestion` or any other tool in a turn that contains an overview.** Stop and wait for the user's chat reply before the next category or execution.
6. **Execute approved actions only** — apply only what the user approved per category. Ensure cleaning labels exist (create if the provider supports it and the label is missing). Close duplicates per [cleaning-rules.md](references/cleaning-rules.md). Append labels; do not remove existing labels unless the user asked.
7. **Emit summary** — report what was planned, what was approved, what succeeded, and what failed.

## Cleaning Categories

| Category | Action | Trigger |
| -------- | ------ | ------- |
| **Duplicates** | Close as duplicate; link to canonical issue | Same title (normalized), `duplicateOf` relation, or explicit duplicate label |
| **Missing assignee** | Add label `needs-assignee` | No assignee on an active issue |
| **Missing acceptance criteria** | Add label `needs-acceptance-criteria` | No acceptance-criteria section in description/body (see rules) |
| **Missing milestone/epic** | Add label `needs-milestone` | No milestone, epic, cycle, sprint, or project (whichever the provider uses) |
| **Stale** | Add label `stale` | Active issue with `updatedAt` **≥ 14 days** ago |

One issue may receive multiple tags. Duplicates are mutually exclusive with other categories — close them, do not tag.

## Approval Gate

After Step 4 findings, approve in this **fixed order** — one category per turn:

1. Duplicates — close
2. Tag `needs-assignee`
3. Tag `needs-acceptance-criteria`
4. Tag `needs-milestone`
5. Tag `stale`

### Per-category flow (two-part message, one turn per category)

For each category where N > 0:

**Part A — overview (required)**  
Post the full `// [OVERVIEW — …] //` block: every issue with plain title, **What**, and **Flag**. User must be able to decide without opening Linear.

**Part B — approval ask (same message, after overview)**  
One line at the bottom:

```
Approve **<action>** for all <N> issues above? Reply: `approve all` · `skip` · or list IDs to include/exclude.
```

Then **end the turn**. No tools. No `AskQuestion`. Wait for the user's next message.

After the user replies, record approved · skipped · modified, then post the next category overview (if any). After all categories, run Step 6 once.

When N = 0, skip the category silently.

### Approval rules

- **Never use `AskQuestion`** — it hides the overview behind a modal. Chat reply only.
- **Never call tools in the same turn as findings or overview** — fetch data first; overview is the last thing in the reply.
- Default is **no writes** — silence or ambiguity means skip that category.
- Never combine two categories in one turn.
- Never execute mid-approval — collect all replies first, then write once.

## Output Format

In emitted output, **all characters between `[` and `]` must be UPPERCASE** — section headers, labels, and any dynamic bracket text (e.g. `[OVERVIEW — NEEDS-ASSIGNEE]`).

### Findings (before approval — counts only)

Show this first. Keep to **≤ 8 lines**. No per-issue detail here — that goes in category overviews.

```
// [FINDINGS] //
Provider: <name> · Scope: <team | project> · Scanned: <N total>, <M active>

Counts: duplicates <N> · unassigned <N> · missing AC <N> · missing milestone <N> · stale <N>

Already clean: <one line>

Proposed: <comma-separated actions with counts, or `No changes needed.`>
```

Then **in the same reply**, if the first category with N > 0 is duplicates, post its overview immediately below findings. Otherwise post the first non-empty category overview. Do not split findings and first overview across turns.

Findings rules:

- Counts and one-line "already clean" only in the findings header.
- Per-issue detail always in the overview block below, never in findings alone.

### Category overview (required — user reads this before approving)

**Must be visible chat text**, not a tool prompt. One block per category turn.

```
// [OVERVIEW — <CATEGORY NAME>] //
Action: <what will happen if approved, e.g. "Add label needs-assignee">

<IDENTIFIER> — <short plain title, not raw tracker slug>
  What: <one line — what this task delivers>
  Flag: <why this issue is listed, e.g. "no assignee · Todo · milestone: Handout management">

<IDENTIFIER> — <short plain title>
  What: <one line>
  Flag: <why listed>
… cap at 20; append `… and N more.`
```

Overview rules:

- **Short plain title** — strip `// [S-NN]::[change-id] // feat:` prefixes; keep readable (e.g. "Square UI containers").
- **What** — from description/outcome; ≤ 15 words; say what the user gets, not internal IDs.
- **Flag** — category-specific reason plus status, assignee, milestone when relevant.
- Duplicates: include canonical ID and why it wins.
- Stale: include days since last update.
- Stale: include days since last update.
- End every overview with the one-line approval ask (Part B).

Example (full turn — this is the entire assistant reply for that category):

```
// [FINDINGS] //
Provider: Linear · Scope: Tech Heresy · Scanned: 24 total, 5 active
Counts: duplicates 0 · unassigned 5 · missing AC 0 · missing milestone 0 · stale 0
Already clean: duplicates closed; AC tagged; milestones set; updated yesterday
Proposed: needs-assignee (5)

// [OVERVIEW — NEEDS-ASSIGNEE] //
Action: Add label needs-assignee

TEC-19 — Square UI containers
  What: Squared corners on every screen — visual-only restyle
  Flag: no assignee · Todo · milestone: Polish & theming

TEC-20 — Dashboard tile style
  What: Themed header strip and uniform handout tiles on dashboard
  Flag: no assignee · Todo · milestone: Polish & theming

Approve **needs-assignee** for all 5 issues above? Reply: `approve all` · `skip` · or list IDs.
```

### Summary (after execution)

```
// [CLEANING SUMMARY] //
Provider: <name> · Approved: <categories> · Executed: <YYYY-MM-DD>

// [CLOSED DUPLICATES] //
<IDENTIFIER> → closed as duplicate of <CANONICAL_ID>
… or `None.`

// [TAGGED] //
<IDENTIFIER> — added: <label1>, <label2>
… or `None.`

// [SKIPPED / FAILED] //
<IDENTIFIER> — <reason>
… or `None.`
```

Output rules (plan + summary):

- One issue per line; use human identifiers (`ENG-123`, `#42`), not UUIDs.
- Cap each section at **20 items**; append `… and N more.` when truncated.
- Do not invent issues or actions — only report MCP data and confirmed results.
- Findings + first overview belong in one reply when starting approval; later categories get their own reply turns.
- Approval is chat-only — overview first, one-line ask last, then wait for user reply.
